# Real-Time Tic Tac Toe Game  

A real-time multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game built with **React**, **Node.js**, and **WebSocket**. This project allows two players to join the same game room and play against each other in real-time. The game supports smooth synchronization of moves and provides an interactive user experience.  

## Features  
- **Real-time gameplay:** Instant synchronization of moves between players using WebSocket.  
- **Frontend:** Developed with **React** and styled for a clean and responsive interface.  
- **Backend:** Built with **Node.js** and **Express**, using **WebSocket** for real-time communication.  
- **Session management:** Players can join the same game by entering a shared room name.  
- **Keyboard controls:** Use arrow keys to navigate the board and press Enter to select a cell.  
- **Player roles:** The first player is assigned **X**, and the second player is assigned **O** automatically.  
- **State synchronization:** Ensures both players see the same game state at all times.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** React, Vite  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, WebSocket  
- **Real-time communication:** WebSocket  
- **Development tools:** TailwindCSS for styling
